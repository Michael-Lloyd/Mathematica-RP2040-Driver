# Mathematica-RP2040-Driver

An implementation of the Serial device drivers present in Wolfram Mathematica's MicrocontrollerKit library and ecosystem. 

Notebooks for now, while I develop the system. Eventually a git based paclet or submission
to mathematica's Resource Function library (I'll see how far I get).
